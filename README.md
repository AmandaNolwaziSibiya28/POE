Student information : 
Student Number: ST10484405

Programme Name: Web Development

Programme Code: WED5020

Organisation OverView
Crowned by Amanda was founded with the intention of empowering, personalising, and democratising access to beauty. Initially, the brand offered individualised beauty consultations to help customers find routines, looks, and styles that suited their unique personalities and lifestyles. In contrast to face-to-face interactions, online content such as blogs, tutorials, and live sessions allowed the brand to inspire and engage with a larger audience over time. In essence, Crowned by Amanda is committed to empowering individuals through lifestyle and beauty in order to promote confidence and self-worth.

The target audience is made up of customer women who are between the ages of 18 and 35, reside in urban and semi-urban areas, and value beauty, style, and confidence. They are social media users, students, and young professionals looking for reasonably priced, superior hair products. We also help salon owners and hairdressers who supply their clients with high-quality hair products. Many customers struggle to find long-lasting, reasonably priced hair products. By providing our clients with stylish, high-quality hair solutions, we hope to install confidence in them every single day.

Website Goals and Objectives: 
The goal of the website is to provide visitors with an easy-to-use platform where they can explore beauty and style resources more of a central hub for online accesses. 
To give customers access to an educational, interactive, and user-friendly platform that promotes customer interaction while conveying the brand's vision, mission, and offerings.

Key Features and Functinality 
We believe that we can control what can be measured. To ensure that our company and website continue to grow and satisfy the demands of our clients, we maintain a careful eye on important performance indicators including website traffic, conversion rates, and customer happiness. These metrics let us assess how well we are informing our audience, communicating with them, and, hopefully, achieving our goals. By leveraging this data to guide our decision-making, we can enhance user experience, build our brand, and empower more people to wear their crowns with confidence.
